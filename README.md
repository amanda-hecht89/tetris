## The Golden Rule: 

ü¶∏ ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è `Stop starting and start finishing.` üèÅ

If you work on more than one feature at a time, you are guaranteed to multiply your bugs and your anxiety.

## Making a plan

1) **Make a drawing of your app. Simple "wireframes"** 
drew in notebook with Julie
1) **Look at the drawing and name the HTML elements you'll need to realize your vision**
Sec1
  *heading 
  *form with -ingredient
             -qty
             -meausrements
  *input button
  *remove button
Sec2
  *heading
  *meal name input
  *submit name button 
Sec3
  *heading
  *list of meals  
1) **Look at the drawing and imagine using the app. What _state_ do you need to track?** 
Sec1
  *form submit (add ingredient)
  *buttom click (remove last item)
Sec2
  *array of meals  
1) **For each HTML element ask: Why do I need this? (i.e., "we need div to display the results in")** 
Sec1
  *heading to display title
  *div to hold name of ingredient
  *div to hold qty
  *div to hold measurement
  *div to hold submit button
  *div to hold remove button
Sec2
  *heading to display title
  *div to hold meal name 
  *div to hold save button
Sec3
  *heaading to dipslay title
  *list of meals and how many ingredients   
1) **Once we know _why_ we need each element, think about how to implement the "Why" as a "How" (i.e., `resultsEl.textContent = newResults`)**

1) **Find all the 'events' (user clicks, form submit, on load etc) in your app. Ask one by one, "What happens when" for each of these events. Does any state change? Does any DOM update?**

1) **Think about how to validate each of your features according to a Definition of Done. (Hint: console.log usually helps here.)**

1) **Consider what features _depend_ on what other features. Use this dependency logic to figure out what order to complete tasks.**

Additional considerations:
- Ask: which of your HTML elements need to be hard coded, and which need to be dynamically generated?
- Consider your data model. 
  - What kinds of objects (i.e., Dogs, Friends, Todos, etc) will you need? 
  - What are the key/value pairs? 
  - What arrays might you need? 
  - What needs to live in a persistence layer?
- Is there some state we need to initialize?
- Ask: should any of this work be abstracted into functions? (i.e., is the work complicated? can it be resused?)
